# Simple_Ai_chatbot

I've tried creating a simple AI Chatbot using python and tensorflow.

This chatbot takes a json file as input on which it trains the model to chat with the user.

# Demo of the output

You can find the demo of the output by clicking this link  https://youtu.be/pRlyjjMXt0Q

# How to run 
- Clone the repository
- Make changes to the chatbot_input_data.json file if you are willing to change.
- Check requirements.txt for the correct versions of the packages to be installed.
- Once all the packages are imported , run the code. The model will be trained for 20000 steps.
You are free to change the steps (epochs and batch size)
- Chatbot will be active after this.

NOTE : This is a simple bot and the results are sometimes not accurate.
